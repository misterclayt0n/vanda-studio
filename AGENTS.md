## Effect Best Practices

**Before implementing Effect features**, run `effect-solutions list` and read the relevant guide.

Topics include: services and layers, data modeling, error handling, configuration, testing, HTTP clients, CLIs, observability, and project structure.

**Effect Source Reference:** `~/.local/share/effect-solutions/effect`
Search here for real implementations when docs aren't enough.

## Version Control (Jujutsu)

This project uses Jujutsu (jj), not git. **Never push to upstream.**

### Commit Format
```
<context>: <message>
```
Examples: `renderer: optimize text cache`, `editor: fix theme transition`

Keep messages lowercase, no periods.

### Workflow
```bash
jj status                    # check changes
jj describe -m "ctx: msg"    # set commit message
jj new                       # create new commit
jj log                       # view history
```

### Rules
- **Every completed TODO = one commit**
- **Never commit code that doesn't compile** - always run `cargo check` first
- **Never push to upstream**
- **Ask before rebasing**
